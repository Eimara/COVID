# COVID

The following code creates simulations which illustrate the effect of contact tracing on the spread of COVID19 and more specifically the mortality.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

networkx,matplotlib.pyplot as plt,seaborn,imageio, matplotlib.animation as animation,random,math
from PIL Image, ImageDraw
```
pip install
```

## Running the tests

Choose either the barabasi albert model or the watts strogatz model to create the social network. Change the percent value to reflect the percent of the population that agrees to participate in the contact tracing. 

### Printing Graphs 

Set the graphs to be saved in a folder and upload the series of images from that folder into an online GIF maker to create full visualization

## Deployment

Change file address in the create_graph_image() method as well as at the end of the main method.
